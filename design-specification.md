# The Specification

### What it would do:

Allow you to quickly create a "meeting" space with others, which will expire without use.

### The Problem:

The tools available for online code collaboration are currently limited, especially for a spontaneous user. Installing programs is not always desired.

### How It Solves The Problem:

The App will allow a user to quickly create a team and begin collaboration without dealing with user accounts, installing software, browser plugins, etc.

Browser Plugins can be used to augment and improve the service, but the baseline service should be as noted above.

### What Exists Already

Below are sites on the web the provide a similar service:

- Hangouts: Hangouts is the defacto but still is limited, and doesn't allow pair programming without plugins. The plugins are provided by a third party. It relies on voicechat, needing a browser plugin.

- floobits: Floobits is a code editor, but is essentially a fancied textarea. It is feature lacking. It requires an account.

Sites exist that have pair programming tools, but they're behind pro accounts (codepen, cloud9).

## Primary Features:
