# team-collaboration-app (working name)

## Marketable Names:

1. Co-Lab (a lab for working together)
2. CodeSpace
3. Build It (build.it)


# Workflow


We alternate between who writes the HTML and CSS for different sections of the app. Work seperately on our own branches in close communication then merge our work to the master branch. 

#JS Updates

I've added a file called main.js with the object that stores all the text for the app.

I've added a file called saveChat.js that makes sure the chat field is not empty and prints the messages to the console when the user says something.
