##HTML Element: h2
---
###Description
---

There are six heading levels that a web developer can use on a website. Each of these headers are used to introduce a new section on the page and are block-level elements.
The h2 element is of second importance in the six-level hierarchy. We can refer to h2 as a 2nd level heading. As you go down the chain of the header elements (1-6), each header will be slightly smaller than the previous. This is used to highlight the hierarchy of the sections into sub-sections. 

###Usage
---

This first example shows a basic way to use the h2 element.

```<h2> I am a header for a section on the webpage </h2>```


We can also use the h2 element to break-up different sections that are at the same level.
In this example, we have three books and we break them up by using the h2 element. We can then put more information for each book under the heading (h2).

```html
<h2> Book one </h2>
<p>content </p>
<h2> Book Two </h2>
<p> content </p>
<h2> Book Three </h2>
<p> content </p>

```

###Special Notes
---

h2 is considered a sub-heading. It will come after an h1 element, which is the main section of the type of content you are using and structuring. If you use an h3 heading within an h2 heading, then the h3 will be a sub-heading of the h2.

Headings are also very helpful for SEO of a website. Structuring content correctly using header elements will help google and other search engines understand the content better. Along with helping search engines for SEO purposes, properly using headers also help the visitors to your website to understand the structure and layout of your content. 

There are also a few best practices when it comes to headers. 

1. You generally want to use header elements (h1,h2) on every page of your website. 
2. h1 should only be used once per page and you can have multiple h2, etc elements on the page.
